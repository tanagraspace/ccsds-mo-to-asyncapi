# CCSDS MO XML to Async API YAML
- Convert CCSDS MO XML specification files into AsyncAPI YAML document.
- The XML files are located in the [xml-ccsds-mo-prototypes](/xml-ccsds-mo-prototypes/) directory.

## Generate Everything
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest gencode
pytest genyaml
./01_generate_code.sh
./02_generate_yaml.sh
./03_generate_docs.sh
```

Or do it all in one go:
```shell
./generate_all.sh
```

## Notes
- Executing `03_generate_docs.sh` requires `sudo` privileges as it involves changing ownership of files generated by Docker.
- The generated code will be located in the _mo-asyncapi/src_ folder.
