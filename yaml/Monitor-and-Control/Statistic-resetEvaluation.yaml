            If the isStatLinkGroup field is TRUE then the objInstIds field shall contain GroupIdentity object instance identifiers, otherwise the field shall contain StatisticFunction object instance identifiers.
            If the isStatLinkGroup field is TRUE, the requested Group, or the Group objects referenced by that Group, must contain StatisticLink objects otherwise an INVALID error shall be returned.
            The StatisticLink objects referenced, either indirectly via statistic functions or indirectly via groups, by the objInstIds field shall be the StatisticLink objects to match.

            The objInstIds field shall support the wildcard value of '0' and matches all StatisticLink objects of the provider.
            The wildcard value should be checked for first, if found no other checks of supplied object instance identifiers shall be made.
            If a requested function or group is unknown then an UNKNOWN error shall be returned.

          description: |
            If the returnLatestEval Boolean field is TRUE then the latest evaluation result for each of the matched links shall be returned before resetting, otherwise a NULL is returned.
            If an error is raised then no resetting of evaluations shall be made as a result of this operation call.
