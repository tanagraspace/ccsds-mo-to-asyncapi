            The aggInstIds field shall hold the object instance identifiers of the AggregationIdentity objects to be removed from the provider.
            The list may contain the wildcard value of '0'.
            The wildcard value should be checked for first, if found no other checks of supplied object instance identifiers shall be made.
            If a provided AggregationIdentity object instance identifier does not include a wildcard and does not match an existing aggregation then this operation shall fail with an UNKNOWN error.
            Matched AggregationIdentity and AggregationDefinition objects shall not be removed from the COM archive only the list of AggregationIdentity and AggregationDefinition objects in the provider.
            If an error is raised then no aggregations shall be removed as a result of this operation call.
            If the operation succeeds then the provider shall not publish aggregation values for the deleted AggregationIdentity objects anymore.
