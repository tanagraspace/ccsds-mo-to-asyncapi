            The actionInstIds field shall hold the object instance identifiers of the ActionIdentity objects to be removed from the provider.
            The wildcard value of '0' in the list of object instance identifiers shall be supported and matches all actions of the provider.
            The wildcard value should be checked for first, if found no other checks of supplied object instance identifiers shall be made.
            If a provided ActionIdentity object instance identifier does not include a wildcard and does not match an existing ActionIdentity object then this operation shall fail with an UNKNOWN error.
            If a matched definition is still being used by an executing action instance then this operation shall not fail because of this reason.
            Matched ActionIdentity objects shall not be removed from the COM archive only the list of ActionIdentity objects in the provider.
            Removed ActionIdentity object shall not be allowed to be referenced by new action instances.
            If an error is raised then no actions shall be removed as a result of this operation call.
