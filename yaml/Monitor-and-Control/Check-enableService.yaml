            If enableService is set to TRUE the service shall be enabled and evaluation and reporting of check will commence.
            If enableService is set to FALSE then all evaluation of checks shall be suspended and no check transitions will be reported.
            If the enableService value matches the current enabled state of the service then no change shall be made and no error reported. Enabling an already enabled service has no effect.
