            The aggDefDetails field shall hold the name and the AggregationDefinitionDetails to be added.
            The name field must not be the wildcard '*', or empty (an INVALID error shall be returned in this case).
            If the supplied reportInterval or sampleInterval values are not supported by the provider then an INVALID error shall be returned.
            The supplied name must be unique among all AggregationIdentity objects for the domain of the provider otherwise a DUPLICATE error shall be raised.
            If an error is raised then no new identities and definitions shall be added as a result of this operation call.
            If the supplied name matches an existing, but removed, AggregationIdentity then that AggregationIdentity shall be reused otherwise a new AggregationIdentity shall be created.
            The provider shall create a new AggregationDefinition object and store it, and any new AggregationIdentity objects, in the COM archive.
