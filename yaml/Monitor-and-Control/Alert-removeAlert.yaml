            The alertInstIds field shall hold the object instance identifiers of the AlertIdentity objects to be removed from the provider.
            The list may contain the wildcard value of '0'.
            The wildcard value should be checked for first, if found no other checks of supplied object instance identifiers shall be made.
            If a provided AlertIdentity object instance identifier does not include a wildcard and does not match an existing AlertIdentity object then this operation shall fail with an UNKNOWN error.
            Matched AlertIdentity objects shall not be removed from the COM archive only the list of AlertIdentity objects in the provider.
            If an error is raised then no alerts shall be removed as a result of this operation call.
            If the operation succeeds then the provider shall not publish AlertEvent events for the deleted AlertIdentity objects anymore.
